# Note
This is a fork of [DialoKEY](https://github.com/Lucas-Munz/DialoKEY_Codebase), updating it to the current openAI API version and changing the fine-tune targets to be gpt3.5-turbo and gpt4-turbo respectively.

## Careful
The code inside the directory `Evalution\` was not tested and the current requirements file does not include requirements for this code.

# About this project
This repository contains all code necessery to fine-tune DialoKEY, a GPT based model which can answer any question (or continue any conversation) given a set of keywords about the answer.
The original DialoKEY is the output of the following master thesis: [Transforming keywords into conversation](https://utheses.univie.ac.at/detail/67331/).

All prompts to DialoKEY have to end with `Answer\n\n###\n\n`. This makes it easier for GPT to recognize that the prompt has ended.

All completions DialoKEY makes end with `END` this allows you to specify it as a stop token.

# Example interactions with DialoKEY

## Interaction 1

Simple interaction with DialoKEY.

### Prompt:
```
Question: What is the nature of your complaint?
Keywords: neighbor illegally dumping garbage
Answer:\n\n###\n\n
```

### DialoKEY output:
```
My neighbor is illegally dumping garbage in my yard. END
```

## Interaction 2

A more complex interaction with DialoKey, including a dialogue history.
```
Question: Where are you heading to?
Answer: I'm trying to go downtown.
Question: I could tell you where to get off.
Answer: You can? That would be very nice of you. Thank you.
Question: I'm happy to help a stranger anytime.
Keywords: street
Answer:\n\n###\n\n
```

```
What's the street that I should get off on? END
```


# Installation

Create a python 3.11 environment and install the packages in the requirements.txt
(The code was tested on python 3.11.7)

Some notebooks will further require you to set your OpenAI API key as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` envrionment variable. 

Linux:
(Inside the root of this repository)
```
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Other OS analogously


# Usage note

When creating new dataset, you can use: <https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chat_finetuning_data_prep> to validate whether your dataset is correct and to estimate the costs of the fine tune.
